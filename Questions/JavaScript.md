1. ### What is the difference between == and === operators
JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,

- Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
- Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value. There are two special cases in this,
1.NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
2.Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
- Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
- Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
- Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==. i.e, null===undefined --> false but null==undefined --> true
Some of the example which covers the above cases,

```js
0 == false   // true
0 === false  // false
1 == "1"     // true
1 === "1"    // false
null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false
'0' == false // true
'0' === false // false
[]==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
{}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
```

2. ### What is the currying function
Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument. Currying is named after a mathematician Haskell Curry. By applying currying, a n-ary function turns it into a unary function.

Let's take an example of n-ary function and how it turns into a currying function,
```js
const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // 6

const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;
curryUnaryFunction(1); // returns a function: b => c =>  1 + b + c
curryUnaryFunction(1)(2); // returns a function: c => 3 + c
curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3); // returns the number 6
```
Curried functions are great to improve code reusability and functional composition.

3. ### What is memoization

Memoization is a programming technique which attempts to increase a functionâ€™s performance by caching its previously computed results. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache.
Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,

```javascript
const memoizAddition = () => {
    let cache = {};
    return (value) => {
    if (value in cache) {
        console.log("Fetching from cache");
        return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.
    } else {
        console.log("Calculating result");
        let result = value + 20;
        cache[value] = result;
        return result;
    }
    };
};
// returned function from memoizAddition
const addition = memoizAddition();
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached
```

4. ### What is a service worker

A Service worker is basically a script (JavaScript file) that runs in the background, separate from a web page and provides features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Some of the major features of service workers are Rich offline experiences(offline first web application development), periodic background syncs, push notifications, intercept and handle network requests and programmatically managing a cache of responses.

5. ### What is a storage event and its event handler
   
The StorageEvent is an event that fires when a storage area has been changed in the context of another document. Whereas onstorage property is an EventHandler for processing storage events. The syntax would be as below

```js
window.onstorage = functionRef;
```

Let's take the example usage of onstorage event handler which logs the storage key and it's values

```js
window.onstorage = function (e) {
  console.log(
    "The " +
      e.key +
      " key has been changed from " +
      e.oldValue +
      " to " +
      e.newValue +
      "."
  );
};
```
